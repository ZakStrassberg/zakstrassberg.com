    %p I'd like to make this fixed and have the buttons light up when you're in their section. Smooth scrolling when you press the links. maybe animate it to get smaller like code jungle or whatever that website was.

      %p
        I maintain a github repository hosting my dotfiles. They are a work in progress
        (and probably will be so in perpetuity). Send me a message on github
        if you have any questions about my configs.

        The source code for this very website can be found above.

      %p
        I built a diceroller for Discord (a chat client) for one of my favorite tabletop RPGs, Exalted.
        The dice-rolling logic is written in javascript and it uses Node.js to connect to a discord server.
      %p
        It listens for messages starting with
        %code .roll
        , parses the message for parameters, and outputs the roll along with formatting and the number of successes.

      %h1.text-center About
      :markdown
        I've always been intensely interested in the web. Growing up in rural Maine, the internet was a link to the rest of the world unlike anything I had ever encountered before. I cut my teeth in DC++ (an early peer-to-peer file sharing client) and before long I was running game servers and installing Linux in order to play with LAMP. Soon thereafter I discovered IRC and the rest is history.

        I became interested in Biology after an internship at The Jackson Laboratory, a world-class research facility. I would go on to major in Biology at McGill University, although my interest in technology never waned. During this time I continued to hone my technical skills, learning LaTeX and keeping up with new developments in web design.

        After graduating from McGill I spent time deciding what to do next. While volunteering for a lab at Boston University School of Medicine I discovered how fun and exciting coding is. I taught myself Python in a weekend and had a script ready for testing on Monday. Soon thereafter I was offered a position at Stanford University School of Medicine and joined the lab of Dr. Ngan Huang.

        After 2 years at Stanford I was ready for a change and decided to attend Coding Dojo. I wanted to learn new skills and take my entirely self-taught coding skills to the next level. Now I am looking for a job in the tech industry. I am a quick study, a hard worker, and a self-motivated individual.
