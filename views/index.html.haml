  -#     -# About section (parsed from Markdown)
  -#     %h1.text-xs-center About
  -#     :markdown
  -#       I've always been intensely interested in the web. Growing up in rural Maine, the internet was a link to the rest of the world unlike anything I had ever encountered before. I cut my teeth in DC++ (an early peer-to-peer file sharing client) and before long I was running game servers and installing Linux in order to play with LAMP. Soon thereafter I discovered IRC and the rest is history.
  -#
  -#       I became interested in Biology after an internship at The Jackson Laboratory, a world-class research facility. I would go on to major in Biology at McGill University, although my interest in technology never waned. During this time I continued to hone my technical skills, learning LaTeX and keeping up with new developments in web design.
  -#
  -#       After graduating from McGill I spent time deciding what to do next. While volunteering for a lab at Boston University School of Medicine I discovered how fun and exciting coding is. I taught myself Python in a weekend and had a script ready for testing on Monday. Soon thereafter I was offered a position at Stanford University School of Medicine and joined the lab of Dr. Ngan Huang.
  -#
  -#       After 2 years at Stanford I was ready for a change and decided to attend Coding Dojo. I wanted to learn new skills and take my entirely self-taught coding skills to the next level. Now I am looking for a job in the tech industry. I am a quick study, a hard worker, and a self-motivated individual.
