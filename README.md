# ZakStrassberg.com
This is the source for my portfolio at zakstrassberg.com. The website is built on Bootstrap and generated using Serve, an open-source rapid prototyping framework.

I decided to redesign my homepage to brush up on haml and sass. This is also my first time using Bootstrap since high school, and it seems much improved. I am currently using Bootstrap v3.3.6 although I'm eagerly awaiting v4 (mmmm flexbox).

I hope to keep iterating and improving.
